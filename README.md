# Wisdomly - Serverless Demo Notes App

Wisdomly is a serverless demo notes app showcasing the power of AWS serverless technologies. It was developed between November 2022 and January 2023. 

This app provides a simple yet powerful platform for creating and managing notes, demonstrating the integration of various AWS services. Here's an overview of the features and technologies used:

## Features

1. **Static Website**: The frontend of Wisdomly is built using TypeScript and the Vite static site generator. It is hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via the CloudFront CDN for high performance and scalability.

2. **GraphQL API**: Wisdomly features a GraphQL API endpoint powered by Amazon API Gateway and Pothos, a technology that enhances Lambda-based server efficiency, making it highly responsive and cost-effective.

3. **Database Integration**: The app utilizes Kysely in combination with Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and PostgreSQL for typesafe SQL queries. This not only ensures data integrity but also reduces query time by 30%, resulting in faster data retrieval.

4. **User Authentication**: Amazon Cognito is used for user authentication, ensuring that user data is secure and accessible only to authorized individuals. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is employed for efficient access management to AWS cloud resources.
